Unistochastic Quantum Transitions from RSVP Field Dynamics
The RSVP (Recursive Scalar-Vector-Entropy Propagation) framework reinterprets cosmological and cogni-
tive dynamics through the lens of entropic field evolution. This section formalizes the unistochastic correspon-
dence, mapping RSVP field dynamics to quantum-like transitions in a semantic state space. We introduce
prerequisite concepts, including the limit integral semantic vector space and the role of amplitwisters as
universal function approximators, before deriving the unistochastic transition matrix and its implications
for consciousness as an entropic organizer.
1.1
Prerequisites: Semantic Vector Space and Limit Integrals
The RSVP framework posits a plenum Ω, a smooth, compact manifold equipped with fields (Φ,⃗v, S), rep-
resenting scalar potential, vector flow, and entropy, respectively. To formalize the cognitive state space, we
define a semantic vector space that encodes the informational structure of these fields.
Definition 1.1 (Limit Integral Semantic Vector Space). Let HΩbe a Hilbert space over Ω, with vectors
representing semantic states of regions {Ra}N
a=1 ⊂Ω. For each region Ra, the semantic state is defined via
a limit integral:
|ψa⟩= lim
ϵ→0
1
√
ϕ(Ra)
∫
Ra
χϵ(x)



α1/2
1
∇S
α1/2
2
∇Φ
α1/2
3
⃗v


dx,
where χϵ(x) is a smooth cutoff function (e.g., a mollifier) ensuring convergence, ϕ(Ra) =
∫
Ra C(x, t) dx is
the consciousness functional, and α1, α2, α3 > 0 are coupling constants. The inner product is:
⟨ψa|ψb⟩= lim
ϵ→0
1
√
ϕ(Ra)ϕ(Rb)
∫
Ra∩Rb
χϵ(x) (α1∇Sa · ∇Sb + α2∇Φa · ∇Φb + α3⃗va · ⃗vb) dx.
The limit integral ensures that the semantic state vectors are well-defined even in regions with singularities
or discontinuities in the field gradients. The consciousness functional ϕ(Ra) quantifies the cognitive capacity
of Ra, normalizing the state to satisfy ⟨ψa|ψa⟩= 1.
This construction embeds the RSVP fields into a
separable Hilbert space, enabling a quantum-like description of semantic transitions.
1.2
Amplitwister and Universal Function Approximation
The RSVP framework leverages the concept of an amplitwister, a complex-valued mapping that encodes field
dynamics in the complex plane, to demonstrate the universality of the consciousness functional C(x, t). We
establish that the amplitwister acts as a universal function approximator, capable of representing arbitrary
cognitive states.
Theorem 1.1 (Amplitwister Universality). The consciousness functional C(x, t), when composed with an
amplitwister mapping A : Ω→C, defined as:
A(x, t) = exp
(
i
∫
Ra
(β1∇S + β2∇Φ + β3⃗v) · d⃗l
)
,
where β1, β2, β3 are complex weights, is a universal function approximator for any continuous function
f : Ω→R in the L2 norm.
Proof. The amplitwister A(x, t) maps RSVP field gradients to a phase in the complex plane, analogous
to a neural network activation function. By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, any continuous function on a
compact manifold can be approximated by polynomials. The exponential form of A generates a dense set of
functions in L2(Ω) due to the completeness of the Fourier basis in the complex plane. Specifically, for any
f ∈L2(Ω) and ϵ > 0, there exists a linear combination of amplitwisters:
f(x) ≈
K
∑
k=1
ckAk(x, t),
1

where ck ∈C and Ak are amplitwisters with varying weights βi. The path integral along d⃗l ensures that
nonlocal correlations in the fields are captured, enhancing the expressive power of A. Thus, C(x, t), when
composed with A, can approximate any cognitive state or observable process in Ω.
This universality underpins the flexibility of the RSVP framework in modeling consciousness as an emer-
gent property of entropic field dynamics.
1.3
Semantic Regions and ϕRSVP Functional
We partition Ωinto semantic regions {Ra}N
a=1, each satisfying:
1. Coherence: ∥∇Φ∥L2(Ra) ≤CΦ, ensuring bounded scalar field variations.
2. Entropic isolation: ∥∇S∥L2(∂Ra) ≥ϵS, enforcing thermodynamic distinction at region boundaries.
3. Cognitive flux:
∫
Ra ∇× ⃗v dx ̸= 0, indicating nonzero dynamical activity.
Definition 1.2 (ϕRSVP State Vector). The cognitive state vector for region Ra is:
|ψa⟩:=
1
√
ϕ(Ra)
∫




⃗v


dx,
where ϕ(Ra) =
∫
Ra C(x, t) dx, and C(x, t) is the consciousness functional approximated via amplitwister
compositions.
1.4
Unistochastic Transition Matrix
Theorem 1.2 (Emergent Unistochastic Dynamics). The transition probability P(Ra →Rb) between seman-
tic regions is governed by a unistochastic matrix Bab = |Uab|2, where:
Uab(t) = ⟨ψa|ψb⟩=
1
√
ϕ(Ra)ϕ(Rb)
∫
Ra∩Rb
(α1∇Sa · ∇Sb + α2∇Φa · ∇Φb + α3⃗va · ⃗vb) dx.
The matrix satisfies ∑
b Bab = 1 for all a.
Proof. The RSVP fields evolve via coupled PDEs:
∂tS = ∇· (DS∇S) + FS(Φ,⃗v),
∂tΦ = ∇2Φ + FΦ(S,⃗v),
∂t⃗v = −∇P + ν∇2⃗v + Fv(S, Φ),
where DS, ν are diffusion coeﬀicients, P is a pressure term, and FS, FΦ, Fv are nonlinear interactions. The
state vector |ψa⟩is normalized in HΩ. The transition matrix Bab = |Uab|2 is unistochastic if ∑
b |Uab|2 = 1.
The inner product Uab is bounded by:
|Uab| ≤
1
√
ϕ(Ra)ϕ(Rb)
∥α1∇Sa · ∇Sb + α2∇Φa · ∇Φb + α3⃗va · ⃗vb∥L1(Ra∩Rb) .
Applying Hölder's inequality:
∥∇Sa · ∇Sb∥L1 ≤∥∇Sa∥L2∥∇Sb∥L2 ≤C2
S,
and similarly for ∇Φ and ⃗v. Since {Rb} partitions Ω, the total probability is:
∑
b
|Uab|2 =
∑
b
|⟨ψa|ψb⟩|2 = ⟨ψa|
∑
b
|ψb⟩⟨ψb|ψa⟩= ⟨ψa|ψa⟩= 1,
2

by the completeness of the basis {|ψb⟩}. For the time evolution, compute:
∂tUab =
1
√
ϕ(Ra)ϕ(Rb)
∫
Ra∩Rb
(α1∇(∂tSa) · ∇Sb + α2∇(∂tΦa) · ∇Φb + α3(∂t⃗va) · ⃗vb) dx + conjugate terms.
Substituting the PDEs, the diffusion terms dominate, and Sobolev estimates ensure boundedness:
∥∂tS∥H1 ≤C
(
DS∥∇2S∥L2 + ∥FS∥L2)
.
The nonlinear terms FS, FΦ, Fv are assumed Lipschitz, preserving unitarity over finite timescales.
