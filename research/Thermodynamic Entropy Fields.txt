Entropy, Geometry, and the RSVP Field: A Thermodynamic
Theory of the Cosmos
Abstract
We introduce the Relativistic Scalar-Vector-Entropy Propagation (RSVP) framework, a unified ther-
modynamic and information-theoretic model of cosmic evolution. Rejecting traditional metric expansion,
RSVP posits that the universe's large-scale structure and temporal dynamics emerge from local interac-
tions of a scalar entropy potential Φ, a vector entropy flux ⃗v, and an entropy density S. Formulated as
a classical field theory with extensions to BV-BRST quantization and AKSZ sigma models, RSVP inte-
grates derived geometry, computational simulation, and speculative applications to consciousness. We
outline the theory's dynamical equations, geometric foundations, numerical implementation via RSVPy-
Torch, and cosmological implications, including a reinterpretation of redshift, structure formation, and
the arrow of time. RSVP offers a falsifiable path toward understanding time, structure, and cognition in
an entropically driven cosmos.

Introduction
Contemporary cosmology, anchored in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm, models the uni-
verse as an expanding manifold driven by dark energy and governed by general relativity. However, this
framework struggles with conceptual challenges, including the nature of the cosmological constant, the initial
singularity, and the arrow of time. The Relativistic Scalar-Vector-Entropy Propagation (RSVP) framework
proposes a radical alternative, reinterpreting cosmic evolution as a thermodynamic process driven by en-
tropy descent within a non-expanding plenum. By integrating scalar potential Φ, vector flux ⃗v, and entropy
density S, RSVP unifies classical field theory, derived geometry, and computational simulation to address
fundamental questions about time, structure, and consciousness.
This paper synthesizes RSVP's core ontology, dynamical equations, geometric foundations, numerical
realization, and cosmological implications. We also explore speculative extensions to consciousness, posi-
tioning RSVP as a bridge between physics, neuroscience, and information theory. Section 2 defines the field
triplet, Section 3 derives the governing PDEs, Section 4 outlines the derived geometric framework, Section 5
describes the RSVPyTorch simulator, Section 6 details cosmological predictions, Section 7 explores cognitive
applications, and Section 8 charts future directions.

Core Field Ontology
The RSVP framework is defined on a smooth or derived manifold X, representing a relativistic plenum. The
fundamental fields are:
• Φ : X →R, a scalar entropy potential governing thermodynamic smoothing.
• ⃗v : X →TX, a vector entropy flux encoding local directionality of structure formation.
• S : X →R+, an entropy density tracking informational complexity and disorder.
Definition 2.1 (RSVP Field Triplet). The RSVP plenum is a tuple (X, Φ,⃗v, S), where X is a smooth or
derived manifold, and Φ, ⃗v, S are fields satisfying continuity and differentiability conditions on X. The
triplet evolves under a variational principle minimizing an entropic action functional.

The scalar Φ acts as a potential driving entropy descent, analogous to gravitational potential but coupled
to informational complexity. The vector ⃗v models flows such as baryonic motion or thermodynamic fluxes,
while S quantifies local entropic states. This ontology emerges from the hypothesis that physical structure
is a manifestation of local entropy minimization.

Dynamical Equations and Thermodynamic Evolution
The RSVP fields evolve according to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), derived
variationally from an action functional or phenomenologically from thermodynamic principles:
∂S
∂t + ∇· (S⃗v) = ∇2S + Σ(Φ,⃗v),
(1)
∂Φ
∂t = ∇2Φ + βΦ(⃗v · ∇× ⃗v),
(2)
∂⃗v
∂t = −∇Φ + ∇× ⃗v,
(3)
where Σ(Φ,⃗v) = ρ(∇· ⃗v) −λ∥∇× ⃗v∥is the entropy production term, ρ, λ, β are coupling constants, and ∇2
denotes the Laplacian on X.
The entropy equation (1) combines advection, diffusion, and a source term modeling entropy production
from divergence (compression) and curl (shear). The scalar equation (2) includes a helicity term, aligning Φ
with topological vorticity. The vector equation (3) evolves ⃗v via gradient descent on Φ and preserves angular
momentum through curl dynamics. These equations link thermodynamics, hydrodynamics, and structure
formation into a coherent entropic framework.
Theorem 3.1 (Entropic Consistency). The system (1-3) conserves total entropy
∫
X S dx in the absence of
sources (Σ = 0) and ensures non-negative entropy production when ρ, λ > 0.
Proof. Integrate (1) over X:

)
dx.
By the divergence theorem,
∫
X ∇· (S⃗v) dx = 0 for a closed manifold. The diffusion term
∫
X ∇2S dx =
∫
∂X ∇S · d⃗n = 0, and Σ ≥0 ensures non-negative entropy growth.

Derived Geometric Foundations
RSVP is formulated in the language of derived algebraic geometry, providing a rigorous substrate for quantum
extensions and singularity resolution. The moduli space of field configurations is a derived stack, equipped
with a (-1)-shifted symplectic structure in the sense of Pantev-Toën-Vaquié-Vezzosi (PTVV) theory. The
AKSZ construction casts RSVP as a topological sigma model from a source dg-manifold T[1]X to a target
stack of entropy fields.
Definition 4.1 (Derived RSVP Stack). The moduli space MRSVP of RSVP field configurations is a derived
stack, with a (-1)-shifted symplectic form ω = δα, where α is a 1-form encoding entropy gradients. The
AKSZ action is:
SAKSZ =
∫
T [1]X
⟨χ, dχ⟩+ χ∗LRSVP,
where χ : T[1]X →MRSVP is a field map, and LRSVP is the RSVP Lagrangian.
The BV-BRST formalism introduces antifields and ghosts to handle gauge redundancies, such as coordi-
nate reparametrizations. This ensures consistency in the presence of singularities (e.g., black hole entropy
spikes) and topological phase transitions (e.g., cosmic web bifurcations).

Numerical Realization: RSVPyTorch
To operationalize RSVP, we developed RSVPyTorch, a GPU-accelerated simulator of the field equations
(1-3). Key features include:
• 3D grid-based finite difference solvers for Φ, ⃗v, and S.
• Dynamic computation of Σ from vorticity and divergence.
• Helicity toggle to probe topological alignment.
• Modular interface for coupling to neural networks learning parameters (e.g., β, diffusivity).
RSVPyTorch enables hypothesis testing against cosmological data, such as:
• Galactic spin alignment (TNG simulations).
• Entropy filamentation in voids (SDSS surveys).
• Redshift as entropic diffusion.
• Non-Gaussian power spectra.
Future work will integrate variational inference and data assimilation to match RSVP dynamics to ob-
servational datasets.

Cosmological Implications
RSVP reinterprets cosmic evolution, rejecting ΛCDM assumptions:
• No metric expansion: The universe is a non-expanding plenum, with redshift arising from entropic
diffusion.
• Entropy-driven time: The arrow of time emerges from entropy smoothing, not thermodynamic
equilibrium.
• Structure formation: Galaxies and voids are entropic defects driven by ∇Φ, not Newtonian gravity.
• Cyclic plenum: RSVP supports asymptotically smooth or cyclic configurations, avoiding initial sin-
gularities.
Testable predictions include:
• Anomalous redshift patterns deviating from Hubble's law.
• Helicity signatures in large-scale structure.
• Entropy plateaus in void regions.

Consciousness, Cognition, and Thermodynamic Geometry
RSVP extends speculatively to consciousness, modeling cognitive systems as submanifolds within the plenum:
• Φ as semantic potential, driving meaningful differentiation.
• ⃗v as information flow, traversing cognitive networks.
• S as phenomenological entropy, encoding complexity.
This framework integrates with:
• Integrated Information Theory (IIT) via entropic curvature metrics.

• Bayesian brain models through entropy descent priors.
• Predictive coding under thermodynamic constraints.
Conscious events may correspond to vorticity bifurcations or topological shifts in entropy gradient flow,
quantifiable via a consciousness functional ϕRSVP.

Future Directions
To advance RSVP, we propose:
• Physical Validation: Compare RSVP dynamics with TNG, SDSS, and CMB data.
• Neurodynamic Modeling: Simulate cognitive field evolution and define ϕRSVP.
• Learning and Inference: Use deep learning to infer coupling terms and develop hybrid models with
transformer architectures.

Conclusion
RSVP offers a thermodynamic, information-theoretic synthesis of cosmic evolution, structure formation, and
consciousness. By rejecting metric expansion and embracing entropy descent, it redefines the universe as a
diffusing, meaning-making plenum. Through rigorous mathematics, computational tools like RSVPyTorch,
and testable predictions, RSVP charts a falsifiable path toward an entropic theory of everything.
