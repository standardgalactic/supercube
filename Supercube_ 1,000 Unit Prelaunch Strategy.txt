Supercube: 1,000 Unit Prelaunch Strategy

NG
Perfect ‚Äî now we're talking
prelaunch scale
: 1,000 full
Supercube units
, each with 12 folded cardboard
Triteks
and
24 small bar magnets
, packaged with a vector diagram and clear plastic window.
This approach is smart:
The
Triteks are folded from printed sheets
(12 per cube √ó 1,000 = 12,000 sheets).
The
magnets are packaged separately
, placed inside folded Triteks by user or pre-inserted by assembly workers.
You're holding off on custom-molded magnets shaped like Triteks until scaling justifies tooling costs.

## üöÄ Assembly Plan for 1,000 Supercubes
### Phase 1: Material Prep
Order
24,000 bar magnets
in bulk (rare earth, rounded edge preferred).
Print
12,000 Tritek sheets
, pre-scored if possible.
Order 1,000 branded packaging boxes with clear top windows.
Print 1,000 vector diagram inserts (minimal instructions).
### Phase 2: Assembly Pipeline
Fold 12 Triteks per unit from pre-printed sheets
Place 2 magnets per Tritek (either manual or semi-guided jig)
Insert all 12 into box tray
Add instruction insert
Apply labels, safety notice ("Contains Magnets!")
Seal box and stack for shipping

This is an excellent prelaunch strategy! You've found the sweet spot between keeping costs manageable and delivering a quality product. The 5-10√ó margin gives you great flexibility for marketing, fulfillment, and iteration.
A few tactical thoughts on your pipeline:
Material Sourcing Priorities:
Magnets first
- these have the longest lead times and biggest cost variability. N35 or N42 neodymium bars (5-8mm) with rounded edges for safety
Pre-scoring is crucial
- worth paying extra for die-cut fold lines on the Tritek sheets. Clean folds = professional look
Box design
- that clear window is smart for retail appeal, but consider a magnetic closure instead of tape for premium feel
Assembly Efficiency:
Your pipeline could benefit from simple jigs - even cardboard templates for consistent magnet placement. With 1,000 units, small optimizations compound quickly.
Safety & Compliance:
Don't forget age warnings (14+ recommended with rare earth magnets) and basic safety inserts. Some retailers require specific magnet safety compliance documentation.
I'd be most interested in helping with:
A packaging mockup
- visualizing that clear window display with the folded Triteks inside
Vendor sourcing strategy
- especially for bulk magnet suppliers with good safety specs
The instruction vector diagram
- making it intuitive enough that people immediately "get" the folding concept
Which direction feels most valuable for your next step? The packaging visualization could be great for early marketing and investor conversations.
