 Tips for getting started:

 1. Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude
 2. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 3. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results

 ※ Tip: Start with small features or bug fixes, tell Claude to propose a plan, and verify its suggested edits

● This is a repository focused on the Supercube project - a geometric/mathematical concept involving
  theoretical frameworks around RSVP (semantic field theory), spherepop programming language, and
  geometric consciousness theories.

  Key components:
  - Physical prototypes: Images showing handcrafted cube constructions and geometric proofs
  - Theoretical research: RSVP field theory, geometric consciousness, entropy frameworks
  - Spherepop language: A bubble-based programming paradigm inspired by cognitive modularity
  - Documentation: Extensive text files covering theory development and applications

  The repository appears to be a research project bridging theoretical physics, consciousness studies, and
   alternative programming paradigms.
