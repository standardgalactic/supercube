SpherePop: Visual Expression Evaluation
Compartir
NG
This is a beautifully thought-out interactive visual implementation of SpherePop—a direct mapping of your bubble metaphor to both mathematical structure and user interface design.
Let's break down what this means for SpherePop as a language, a paradigm, and a tool.
---
🧠 Core Principle of SpherePop
Expressions are visualized as nested circles (bubbles). Popping a bubble = evaluating and collapsing its local scope.
In your example:
((a + b) + c) + d
becomes
→ a circle around a + b
→ inside a larger circle for (a + b) + c
→ inside a larger circle for ((a + b) + c) + d
Clicking any circle evaluates its immediate scope (inner expression) and replaces the visual with the result.
---
🌀 SpherePop Semantics
Evaluation is Explicit and Visual
Popping = Executing
You don't implicitly reduce terms in background. The user initiates evaluation by clicking—embodying intentional computation.
Inner-to-Outer Evaluation
Just like the evaluation strategy in Lisp or any S-expression-based system—but now embodied in interactive geometry.
---
💡 Examples You Provided
Expression    Stepwise Popping
(((1 + 2) + 3) + 4)    → (((3) + 3) + 4) → ((6) + 4) → (10) → 10
(((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + (5 + 6))    → ((3 + 7) + 11) → 10 + 11 → 21
((6)÷(2(2+1)))    → (6 ÷ (2×3)) → 6 ÷ 6 → 1
This makes the computation process visible, traceable, and meaningful—ideal for education, programming pedagogy, or expressive computation.
---
🧩 Technical Structure from Your Script
Your implementation includes:
✅ evaluateExpression()
Triggers when a bubble is clicked.
Evaluates the expression.
Animates the bubble popping (.popped class), then replaces the content with the result.
✅ parseExpression()
Safely strips parentheses and uses Function constructor for math parsing.
Avoids eval() for safety.
✅ createCircle()
Generates a DOM element with a bubble-like appearance.
Adds a click handler to allow popping/evaluating that specific scope.
✅ initExamples()
Constructs three expression trees:
Basic
Complex (with nested sums)
Deeper (with double-nesting of subexpressions)

🔍 SpherePop as a Language
This isn't just a UI — it's a new kind of visual programming language:
🎯 Characteristics
Feature    Description
Nested visual ASTs    Represented by concentric or embedded bubbles
Execution by interaction    Popping is controlled evaluation
Scope-bound execution    Each bubble has an isolated scope — very Lisp-like
Pure expressions    Side-effect-free computation as default
Stepwise reduction    Intuition-first, pedagogically powerful
Live visual programming    Ideal for teaching arithmetic, algebra, functional thinking, recursion
---
🔄 Potential Extensions
Here are directions SpherePop can evolve:
Functional Bubbles
Define and reuse functions ((square x) => (* x x)).
Click a function bubble to expand or inline the definition.
Bubble Types
Add visual cues: color for type (number, function, boolean).
Animate different operators differently (e.g., multiplication = growing bubble).
Time-based / Dynamic Evaluation
Bubbles that evaluate over time ((countdown 5) pops each second).
Animate partial evaluation: make computation an event.
Textual + Visual Duality
Allow editing the underlying textual form ((((1+2)+3)+4)) that syncs with bubble view.
Think of a REPL that bubbles.
Tactile Scripting for Kids
Could be used like a math Scratch — click and build programs from floating interactive expressions.
---
🔧 Want Help With:
A live REPL interface for SpherePop?
A parser that converts Lisp-like input into nested DOM bubbles?
Translating SpherePop into a full language spec?
A VS Code plugin or Electron app?
Using SpherePop as a backend visual debugger for functional code?
Let me know what direction you want to push next. This is a deeply original concept that bridges language, interface, and cognition.

You've beautifully articulated the vision behind SpherePop! This really is more than just a UI - it's a fundamental rethinking of how we interact with computational expressions. The idea that "popping = evaluating" creates this beautiful direct manipulation paradigm where computation becomes a physical, intentional act.
I'm particularly excited by your insight about this being a "direct mapping of bubble metaphor to both mathematical structure and user interface design." This bridges the gap between how we think about nested expressions conceptually and how we interact with them.
Let me build on this with a more sophisticated implementation that explores some of the extensions you mentioned:
SpherePop: Advanced Interactive Expression Engine
Artefacto interactivo
This advanced implementation brings SpherePop closer to being a full visual programming language! Here are the key enhancements:
🚀 New Features Added:
1. Enhanced Parser
Handles complex nested expressions with proper operator precedence
Supports variables (x, y, PI, E) and mathematical functions (sin, cos, sqrt, factorial)
Creates proper Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
2. Visual Type System
Different bubble colors for numbers, operators, expressions, functions, and variables
Hover tooltips showing type information and current values
Size-based hierarchy showing expression complexity
3. Interactive Elements
Live variable panel showing current values
Evaluation history tracking each "pop" operation
Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to create expressions)
Multiple example expressions covering different mathematical domains
4. Advanced Animation System
Smooth pop/appear animations with cubic-bezier easing
Staggered child positioning within parent expressions
Proper visual feedback for all interactions
🎯 SpherePop Language Features:
Scope Visualization
: Each bubble represents a computational scope that can be independently evaluated
Lazy Evaluation
: Expressions aren't computed until their bubbles are explicitly popped
Visual AST
: The nested bubble structure directly mirrors the mathematical expression tree
Type-Aware Interface
: Different visual treatments for different kinds of mathematical objects
🔮 This Opens Up Exciting Possibilities:
Educational Tool
: Perfect for teaching order of operations, function composition, and algebraic thinking
Visual REPL
: Could serve as an interface for functional programming languages
Mathematical Exploration
: Interactive way to explore complex formulas step-by-step
Accessibility
: Makes abstract mathematical concepts physically tangible
The beauty of SpherePop is that it makes the invisible visible - turning abstract computational processes into concrete, interactive objects. Each bubble becomes a "computational affordance" that invites exploration.
What aspect would you like to push further? I'm thinking we could explore:
Function definition bubbles
(define your own functions visually)
Time-based evaluation
(bubbles that evolve over time)
3D SpherePop
(using Three.js for true spherical nesting)
SpherePop scripting language
(textual syntax that compiles to bubbles)

It's great but we should animate it further by popping each step Thanks for sharing that snippet! Let me unpack and interpret your spherepop code example, then explain the popping behavior it illustrates:
---
Your Spherepop Expression
( How
   ( + 
     ( - ( 1 ) ( 2 ) )
     ( - ( 1 ) ( 2 ) )
     play
   )
   spherepop: 
   ( 
     (Find the ( innermost bubble ) ) 
     and then pop as many ( + b u b b l e s ) as you can ( . ) 
   )
)
---
What I See:
The outermost bubble is ( How ... ) — probably the program entry or a top-level scope.
Inside it is a bubble with the plus operator ( + ... ) that has two subtraction bubbles:
( - (1) (2) )
( - (1) (2) )
Then a token play inside the plus bubble — maybe a command or literal.
Then a descriptive bubble labeled spherepop: containing instructions expressed as nested bubbles, talking about:
Finding the innermost bubble
Popping as many bubbles labeled ( + b u b b l e s ) as possible
A period ( . ) bubble closing the thought
---
Interpretation of Behavior
Step 1: Find the Innermost Bubble(s)
The innermost bubbles here are the deepest nested (1) and (2) bubbles inside each subtraction bubble.
These are smallest scope units.
Step 2: Pop as many ( + b u b b l e s ) as you can
This suggests the operational semantics where you:
Locate deepest nested bubbles
Begin popping them (executing and closing scope)
Then pop upwards bubbles labeled with + until no more can be popped
---
Conceptual Execution Flow:
Pop innermost (1) and (2) bubbles: evaluate these literal values, then bubble exit.
Pop subtraction bubbles ( - (1) (2) ): perform subtraction on popped values.
Pop the addition bubble `( + ... ): sum the results of subtractions.
Possibly play triggers some action or effect at this point.
The descriptive spherepop: bubble is like meta commentary or a nested instruction set guiding the popping strategy.
---
How This Reflects Spherepop Design
The parentheses (bubbles) represent nested scopes or expressions.
Popping bubbles is the act of evaluating and collapsing those expressions locally, then returning the result upward.
Your example shows the recursive, nested nature of popping — from deepest to outer bubbles.
The textual bubble with instructions embodies the self-referential or meta aspect spherepop might support.
---
Would you like me to:
Translate this into executable pseudocode that models spherepop's popping evaluation?
Build a simple interpreter that runs such nested bubbles and implements your popping semantics?
Visualize the popping sequence step-by-step as bubbles collapse?
Just say the word!
Editar
You're absolutely right! The current implementation pops everything at once, but the true beauty of SpherePop is in the
step-by-step cascade
- watching the evaluation ripple from innermost to outermost bubbles. Let me enhance it with proper sequential popping animation:

Perfect! Now SpherePop demonstrates the
true cascading evaluation
you described! Here's what the enhanced version does:
🌊
Cascading Pop Animation
1. Intelligent Depth-First Evaluation
When you click any bubble, it automatically finds the
deepest unevaluated
child
Only evaluates when all children are already numbers (fully resolved)
Creates a beautiful ripple effect from innermost to outermost
2. Visual Cascade Sequence
Click outer bubble → Finds deepest child → Pops it
↓
Checks if parent can now evaluate → Pops parent
↓
Continues until the entire expression cascades up
3. Enhanced Animations
Child Collapse
: Children spheres shrink and fade before parent evaluation
Staggered Timing
: Multiple children collapse in sequence, not simultaneously
Golden Flash
: Parent sphere flashes gold before transforming to show the "aha!" moment
Smooth Transitions
: Each step has distinct visual phases
🎯
Try the "Cascade Demo"
Load the example
(((1 + 2) + (3 + 4)) + (5 + 6))
and click the outermost bubble. Watch how it:
Finds
(1 + 2)
→ Pops to
3
Finds
(3 + 4)
→ Pops to
7
Evaluates
(3 + 7)
→ Pops to
10
Finds
(5 + 6)
→ Pops to
11
Finally evaluates
(10 + 11)
→ Pops to
21
🧠
This Captures the True SpherePop Philosophy
Your insight about "
find the innermost bubble and pop as many as you can
" is now perfectly embodied:
One Click
triggers the entire cascade
Automatic Depth Discovery
finds the deepest ready-to-evaluate scope
Sequential Popping
creates a mesmerizing chain reaction
Visual Precedence
makes mathematical order of operations viscerally clear
The animation now feels like
mathematical dominoes falling
- each pop enables the next level to resolve, creating this beautiful chain reaction that makes abstract computation feel physical and intuitive.
Try the "Deep Nesting" example for an even more dramatic cascade effect! The visual feedback makes it clear why certain operations must happen before others - SpherePop literally
makes precedence visible

It's awesome meeting we need to center them a bit and give even more examples the create bubbles button doesn't really do anything maybe it could enlarge the larger bubbles and shrink the smaller ones instead
Editar
You're absolutely right! Let me fix the centering and make the "Create Bubbles" button actually do something useful - I love the idea of it being a "focus/zoom" button that adjusts bubble sizes for better visibility!

Perfect! Now SpherePop has been significantly enhanced with:
🎯
Better Centering & Layout
Expression Container
: Proper centering wrapper that keeps bubbles perfectly centered
Responsive Layout
: Bubbles now stay centered even as they resize and animate
Overflow Handling
: Large expressions stay contained within the workspace
🔍
Smart "Focus View" Button
Your brilliant idea implemented! The button now:
Enlarges Large Bubbles
: Makes outer expressions more prominent and easier to click
Shrinks Small Bubbles
: Inner details become compact but still readable
Adds Focus Glow
: Large bubbles get a subtle white glow to draw attention
Smooth Transitions
: 0.8s cubic-bezier animation makes the transformation feel organic
Toggle Behavior
: Click again to reset to original proportional sizes
🚀

- Shows how variables work
Functions
:
((sqrt(16) + pow(2, 3)) / (factorial(3) - 2))
- Complex function composition
Constants
:
(((cos(0) + sin(PI/2)) * E) + (log(E) * PI))
- Mathematical constants in action
Mega Cascade
: A massive nested expression that creates an epic popping sequence
🎨
Enhanced Variables
Extended the variable set:
a=2, b=4, c=6, d=8, e=1, f=3, g=5, h=7
Now supports more complex algebraic expressions
Variables panel shows all current values
🎪
Try the "Mega Cascade"!
This is the showstopper - a deeply nested expression with 16 leaf nodes that creates an absolutely mesmerizing cascade animation. Click the outer bubble and watch the mathematical dominoes fall in perfect sequence!
The
Focus View
button is particularly useful for complex expressions - it makes the clickable outer bubbles larger and easier to target, while keeping the inner details visible but compact. It's like having a mathematical zoom lens!
The combination of perfect centering + smart resizing + tons of examples makes SpherePop feel like a complete mathematical playground now. 🎉
