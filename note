Entropy, Geometry, and the RSVP Field

These sources primarily discuss the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework, a theoretical model proposing that the universe's evolution, cosmic structure, and even consciousness emerge from the dynamic interactions of scalar (Φ), vector (v), and entropy (S) fields.

The texts explore how RSVP provides an alternative to standard cosmological models like ΛCDM, with a focus on entropy descent as a driving force and the generation of topological features like cosmic voids and galactic spins.

The framework aims for mathematical rigor through Lagrangian formalisms and connections to quantum field theory, while also outlining testable predictions against cosmological datasets and neuroscience applications, including a proposed phase vortex tracking toolbox for cognitive studies.

Ultimately, the sources detail the ongoing development and refinement of RSVP into a comprehensive and empirically verifiable theory.
